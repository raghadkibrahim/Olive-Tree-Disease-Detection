# Disease Detection in Olive Trees
Olive trees can be affected by a number of diseases that can be identified in various ways, most of which involve a lot of effort and specilization. In this project,
we shall explore the application of deep learning and machine learning algorithms in detecting some of these disease that tend to infect olive leaves.

### Objectives:
- Construct a model for image classification of diseases in olive leaves

### Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is a collection of over 3,400 
images of olive leaves collected from Denizli City, Turkey. 
The images are classified into the following classes:  

- Leaves infected with Aculus Olearius.
- Leaves infected with peacock spot.
- Healthy olive leaves.


#### Dependencies
The libraries used are the following
